# ASCIIConversion

A project I made many years ago, it allows a user to convert an arbitrary image over to plain text.
The bulk of the UI is made in JavaFX, with some swing components (notably, the text field that holds the converted image) as some of the JFX components could not handle the large amounts of text that the backend of this program generates.
